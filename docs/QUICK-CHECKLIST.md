# SleepWell quick checklist

Checked means implemented in source/build, not fully verified on the phone.
Full supporting evidence stays in FEATURE-CHECKLIST.md and FEATURE-MATRIX.md.

## Current priorities requested by the user

- [x] Shared navigation/control haptics and pressed/selected feedback, with a saved off switch; physical feel remains unchecked.
- [x] First Settings/alarm-menu organization pass: eight groups, search and parent-aware Back; every feature retained.

Latest built increment **731e9725** adds saved radio stations, simpler Tracking setup, measured echo-rhythm review and experimental recorded-audio estimates. These new Android flows still need acceptance; the check marks below do not imply full parity.

## Implemented

- [x] Best-effort prevent-leave and recognized power-menu handling.
- [x] Extra-loud toggle and optional audio gain.
- [x] Gentle volume increase and independent sound/vibration delays.
- [x] Screen sunrise wake-up.
- [x] Flashlight wake-up.
- [x] Snoring/speech analysis, recordings, playback, favorites and retention.
- [x] Automatic schedule/stillness tracking, recurring starts and optional false-start rejection.
- [x] Anti-snoring sound/vibration cues.
- [x] Travel planning, dated sleep shifts, reminders and wake-alarm drafts.
- [x] Per-alarm settings and custom time/duration selectors.
- [x] Weekday, odd/even-week and every-N-day repeats, skips and sunrise schedules.
- [x] Challenge routines, fallbacks and generated printable QR codes.
